  h3 Console legacy profile and firmware improvements
  p A new profile #[+a('/alpakka/manual/profile_console_legacy') Console Legacy] is now implemented. It comes with mouse emulation completely disabled, and #[em right thumbstick emulated] in the 8-direction switch.

  p This is the last fallback for games that may have issues when mouse movement is detected, that do not support mouse and keyboard at all, or in which a second thumbstick is absolutely mandatory. These kind of games #[em should be extremely rare], so if you know some please ping us.

  p To support this new profile, some core features of the firmware had to be improved.

  p A new version of the Alpakka reference firmware was published #[+ax('https://github.com/inputlabs/alpakka_firmware/releases/tag/0.86.0') 0.86.0] with all these changes and the new profile.

  pre: code.
    Changelog 0.86.0:

    - Created Console Legacy profile.
    - Any gamepad axis (thumbstick and analog triggers) can be assigned to any button.
    - Gyro as a configurable input in the profiles.
      - Gyro to mouse mapping can be customized and inverted.
      - Gyro axis Z is now also available to profiles.
      - Foundations to assign any action to gyro axis (still not functional).
    - Gyro modes:
      - GYRO_MODE_ALWAYS_OFF
      - GYRO_MODE_ALWAYS_ON
      - GYRO_MODE_TOUCH_OFF
      - GYRO_MODE_TOUCH_ON
    - Calibration and non-volatile memory now include gyro axis Z offset.

  p This means that now profiles can define gyro behavior as for example:

  pre: code.
    profile.gyro = Gyro_(
        GYRO_MODE_TOUCH_ON,  // Gyro mode.
        ACTIONS(MOUSE_X),    // Gyro axis X.
        ACTIONS(MOUSE_Y),    // Gyro axis Y.
        ACTIONS(KEY_NONE)    // Gyro axis Z.
    );

  p And that any digital button can emulate an analog axis as for example:

  pre: code.
    Button_(
        PIN_A,                    // Physical button.
        NORMAL,                   // Button mode.
        ACTIONS(GAMEPAD_AXIS_LX)  // Actions.
    );

  p These features also set the foundations to be able to assign any action (or group of actions) to gyro directions, for example #[em turn gyro up => press space] which will be an important accessibility feature, specially later in the #[+a('/kapybara') Kapybara] controller. But the implementation is not complete yet.
